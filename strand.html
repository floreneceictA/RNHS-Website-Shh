<h2><u>Accounting, Business, and Managementy,(ABM)</h2>
<p>They say that it takes a business-minded student to pursue the ABM strand (Accounting, Business, and Management). Maybe you have always dreamed of putting up your own business. Or maybe you have always wanted the admirable title of an accountant? Maybe you dream of living the high life of a well-known manager for a company in a lucrative industry. If any of the three sounded like a dream come true, then maybe a path in ABM is for you!</p>

<h2><u>Technical-Vocational Livelihood(TVL)</h2>
<p>Some students are itching to jump into a job as soon as they graduate senior high. The TVL (Technical-Vocational Livelihood) track is the perfect choice for students that want to explore employment opportunities locally and overseas as soon as possible. After finishing any strand under the TVL track, students can apply for national certifications, and automatically get a TESDA National Certificate – a necessary document for making the most of work opportunities as soon as possible.
One of TVL’s most useful strands is ICT (Information and Communications Technology). It opens up careers in large corporations by way of analyzing the design, technology, and implementation of complex information management systems that are key to operation.</p>
